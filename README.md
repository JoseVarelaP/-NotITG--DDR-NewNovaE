	<br>A OpenITG-NotITG Theme that is a work of porting and completing an old 2006 theme that was abandonded by is06, a guy who wanted to make a SuperNova-Like theme for Stepmania 3.9.
  </p>
  <br>Unfortunately, it was discontinued quite a little fast, and the last version was the 2nd Alpha back in late 2006. Today, I'm releasing this version for <strong>OpenITG-NotITG</strong>, where I pretty much completed the theme on my own.
  <br>If I could know who were the original people involved into this project, I would like to show them this port, and say thanks for making this theme, even if it wasn't completed at all, because it was one that really hooked me, and it impressed me by the level of detail and care.

  <br>This theme uses another framework called OITGThemerFallack. You can find more information about it <a href="https://github.com/JoseVarelaP/OITGThemerFallback">here</a>.
